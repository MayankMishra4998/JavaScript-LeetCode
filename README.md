# Qus 1 :- 
Given an integer n, return a counter function. This counter function initially returns n and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc).

# Qus 2 :- 
Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the array.last() method on any array and it will return the last element. If there are no elements in the array, it should return -1.

# Qus 3 :-
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

# Qus 4 :- 
Given a positive integer millis, write an asynchronous function that sleeps for millis milliseconds. It can resolve any value.

# Qus 5 :- 
Given an integer array nums, a reducer function fn, and an initial value init, return the final result obtained by executing the fn function on each element of the array, sequentially, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element.

# Qus 6 :- 
Given an array of functions [f1, f2, f3, ..., fn], return a new function fn that is the function composition of the array of functions.

# Qus 7:- 
Given an integer array arr and a filtering function fn, return a filtered array filteredArr.

The fn function takes one or two arguments:
=> arr[i] - number from the arr
=> i - index of arr[i]

# Qua 8 :-
Given an integer array arr and a mapping function fn, return a new array with a transformation applied to each element.
